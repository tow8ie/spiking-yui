  "readme": "Shifter - Blazingly Fast YUI Builder\n====================================\n\nThe purpose of this project is to replace YUI's use of our old ant [Builder](https://github.com/yui/builder).\n\nWe have out grown our old builder, so it was time to build a new one!\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n[Documentation can be found here](http://davglass.github.com/shifter/)\n\nBuild Status\n------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/davglass/shifter.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/davglass/shifter)\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n    npm -g install shifter\n\nSome Options\n------------\n\nMore detail can be found in the [documentation](http://davglass.github.com/shifter/)\n\n    $ shifter -h\n\n    blazingly fast builds with shifter\n\n    pass no arguments and shifter will build the module from the current directory\n\n       -v/--version            show version\n       -h/--help               show this stuff\n       -m/--modules <module>   limit the modules to build (array: -m foo -m bar)\n       --lint [preferred|defaults|strict] (preferred is the default) lint mode: https://github.com/yui/yui-lint\n       --strict                add \"use strict\" to module wrapper\n       --walk                  Walk the current directory and shift all builds. (cd yui3/src && shifter --walk)\n                                   -m/--modules also supported here for filtering\n       --watch                 Watch the current module and rebuild on file change (if meta file, a loader build will launch)\n                                   --quiet to mute stdout from sub build\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nShifter will parse your current `*.properties` files and convert them into a `build.json` file that\nit can process. It only imports the relevant settings required to build the module.\n\n**It does not import module meta-data**\n\nInstead, Shifter parses the meta-data from the modules `meta/*.json` files and uses that instead.\nSo you don't have to declare your meta-data in more than one place now.\n\nWatching\n--------\n\nShifter can watch your module for changes and build for you. It will only watch files in the\n`./js`, `./css`, `./assets` and `./meta` directories. If a file is changed, it will rebuild the current\nmodule. If a meta file is changes, `Loader` will also be built (*requires latest code*).\n\n\nMigrating\n---------\n\nShifter is designed to work side by side with our current builder (for now) so you don't have to\nswitch over to using it fully if it doesn't work properly for you. Just don't delete your `*.properties`\nfiles until you are sure that Shifter builds your module properly. If it doesn't, file a ticket and\nwe'll get it fixed up ASAP.\n\nShifter will read a `build.json` file if it exists, if one doesn't and it finds a `*.properties` file\nit will generate the `build.json` from them. So if you have issues with the build, just delete the `build.json`\nfile and have Shifter regenerate it after your issue is fixed.\n\n\nGearJS\n------\n\nShifter is built using [GearJS](http://gearjs.org/)\n",
